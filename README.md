# Commerce
I successfully completed Project 2: Commerce as part of the CS50 Web Programming Development course. I implemented a functional e-commerce platform using Django on the back end, and HTML/CSS on the front end. The web application includes features such as user authentication, product listing, bidding functionality, and an interactive user interface.
